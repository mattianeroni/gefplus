GEF+ is a self-maintained free desktop application to facilitate statistical analysis and, in particular, survival analysis. It is designed to be cross platform, even if, for the moment, new Apple processors M1 and M2 are not supported for incompatibility with some adopted libraries.

The application includes several components such as:
- Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)
- Kaplen Meier
- Features Selection
- Cox's Proportional Hazard's model
